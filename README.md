# YouTube-Mix
(Chrome Extention made in collaboration with GPT-4.)
Start a continuous Mix from any song on YouTube using the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Shift+Y.

To install the extention...
1. Download the code and put the two files manifest.json and background.js into a folder that you can call YouTube Mix or the likes.
2. Now open Chrome and Navigate to the Extentions in the top right and click on "Manage Extensions" and new tab will open that will show you all your installed Extensions.
3. Click on "Load unpacked" in the top left and navigate to the Folder you just created and click on it to reveal the two files "manifest.js" and "manifest.json". This shows you that you are in the right place and you can click select.
4. You have now installed the Extention and you can turn it on and off using the toggle on the Extention. (The Extention is manifest 2 but I don't care. It works, but you can rewrite it if you want.)
5. -> Start a continuous Mix from any song on YouTube using the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Shift+Y.
